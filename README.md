# Tic-Tac-idontknow
Console based tic tac toe for beginners and intermediate learners. It may have some "unpleasant  and unwanted special features".
Okay this is a "simple" tic tac toe game you can make with python. I say simple but I spent  a couple of hours without looking for any help as a challenge (-3-)

There may be some, like I said in the description, 'unpleasant and unwanted speacial features". Yeah, that's how we call bugs nowadays. Might update this soon or refactor it if I feel like it which is highly unlikely :P
